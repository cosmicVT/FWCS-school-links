CHANGE LOG:
1.0 - first version started with a few links and the help download and suggest links were added
as commands.

1.1 - more links added and some minor appearance fixes.

1.2 - more links and a patch to some words being different colors.

1.3 - added a randomizer button, made the textbox clear, made the background transition
slower, added a new text for when you enter a wrong code, and added a minecraft link but it
was blocked immediately üôÅ.

1.4 - added drawing link, slightly changed background angle, took out slow roads because
website vanished, fixed a glitch where text still existed in the textbox but it was invisible, made
the random button do more random results, added small animation to the randomizer button as
well as button feedback, general fixes and optimization, added a button at the bottom left that
changes the color of the background. UPDATED 1/29/25

1.5 - Added beat maker link, added button to pause and resume background animation, added
online piano. UPDATED 2/24/25

1.6 - patched cookie clicker, added downloaded games link to install games ON YOUR
COMPUTER, added a discussion board link below the search box where you can freely talk to
others with the website through means of a google doc, changed all 3 link names to better say
what they are/do, added block blast game link, uploaded website to github, no longer need to
update if you use the website, Fixed background button animation. UPDATED 3/24/25

1.7 - Completely revamped how the website runs, shortly after I uploaded the website it got
blocked ao I got to work, from now on the website automatically runs through a proxy when
accessed through the doc or the old downloadable 1.6 version, it will not open through the
github so I made another repository where you can open or download it through github if you'd
like, and the cherry on top, all websites opened will automatically be unblocked because of the
proxy so literally nothing can get blocked ever, expect more better websites soon. UPDATED
